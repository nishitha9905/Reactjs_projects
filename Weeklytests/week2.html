                   Hello there! My name is Oktay and I'm from Berlin, Germany. As a Full-Stack software developer, I specialize in creating visually appealing websites, apps and mobile games. My passion for graphic design isn't just a hobby, it's a key ingredient in every project I work on.
                </p>
                <div id="hide-text" style="display:none;">
                    <p>
                        Growing up bilingual, I developed a love for languages 
                        and I currently speak four of them fluently. 
                        I believe that this skill has given me a unique perspective
                        and allows me to communicate effectively with clients from all over the world.
                        One of my strengths is adding a personal touch to my projects by adding the
                        client's identity and message into the design, creating meaningful and beautiful
                        end products that are both eye-catching and user-friendly.
                   </p>
        
                    <p>
                        In my free time, I enjoy exploring my other passions,
                        such as photography and music production, which provide me 
                        with creative outlets. I am also very passionate about Web3 
                        and everything related to crypto, NFTs and blockchain technology
                        as I believe they have the potential to revolutionize business and online interactions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
